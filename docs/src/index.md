# OMEinsumContractionOrders

This is the documentation for [OMEinsumContractionOrders](https://github.com/TensorBFS/OMEinsumContractionOrders.jl),
a Julia package for the optimization of the contraction order of tensor networks.

**Installation** guide is available in [README.md](https://github.com/TensorBFS/OMEinsumContractionOrders.jl). You can also access its features in [OMEinsum](https://github.com/under-Peter/OMEinsum.jl), which uses it as the default contraction order optimizer.
