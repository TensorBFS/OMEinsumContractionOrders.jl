The quality of the contraction order is quantified by the contraction complexity, which is determined by the chosen contraction order represented by a binary tree. Finding the optimal contraction order, i.e., the contraction order with minimal complexity, is related to the NP-complete problem of finding the tree decomposition with minimal treewidth [Markov2008]. Luckily, a close-to-optimal contraction order is usually acceptable, which could be found in a reasonable time with a heuristic optimizer. In the past decade, methods have been developed to optimize the contraction orders, including both exact ones and heuristic ones. Among these methods, multiple heuristic methods can handle networks with more than 10^4 tensors efficiently [Gray2021], [Roa2024].","category":"page"},{"location":"background/","page":"Background Knowledge","title":"Background Knowledge","text":"For simplicity, in the following sections, we will use the einsum notation in OMEinsum.jl to represent the tensor network contraction: R_ijk = sum_a b c  A_aB_b It is easy to see that the most direct way to calculate the result is to loop over all the indices naively, which requires O(d^N) operations, where d is the dimension of the index and N is the number of indices.
